This is a Programming II project that solves a system of two linear equations using Java. It includes:
- Console-based solution
- Intersection point calculator for two lines
- A GUI version made with Java Swing

## Features
- Checks if the system is solvable
- Calculates the intersection point
- GUI version for user-friendly input

## How to Run
